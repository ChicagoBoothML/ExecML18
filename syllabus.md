## Piazza Discussion Forum

[https://piazza.com/chicagobooth/summer2018/bus41812/home](https://piazza.com/chicagobooth/summer2018/bus41812/home)

You can add yourself to the course here: [https://piazza.com/chicagobooth/summer2018/bus41812](https://piazza.com/chicagobooth/summer2018/bus41812)

We will be using Piazza for class discussion.
Please post any questions that you may have there, rather than emailing TAs or instructors.
All of your classmates will benefit from the public discussions.

We also encourage you to answer other students' questions.
Answering question will reinforce your learning and understanding of the material.
We will carefully check all discussions and give clarification in case of any confusion.
Sometimes the best answer may be "Let me Google that for you..."


## Course Summary

Machine Learning is at the very core of modern Data Analytics, which companies big and small are leveraging to mine commercial value out of their increasingly vast troves of information. This course aims to give you an introduction to a wide range of popular, powerful and highly practical Machine Learning algorithms, with the hope that what you take away here will help you rise up to data-enabled commercial opportunities in your subsequent careers.

You will learn about the state-of-the-art Machine Learning techniques and how to apply them in business related problems. We will introduce techniques in the context of business applications and emphasize how Machine Learning can be used to provide insights and create value from data. Furthermore, this class will help you establish understanding of methodology used in subsequent quantitative classes.

Tentative list of topics that will be covered includes:

* bias-variance trade-off
* k-nearest-neighbor regression and classification
* variable selection in linear and logistic regression; Lasso and ridge regression
* tree based methods
* ensemble methods: random forest and boosting

Each lecture will consist of a methodological part, where students will learn important concepts, and a lab part, where students will learn how to apply learned tools on real data sets in R. In addition, there will be a TA led session every day that will further help students apply the learned concepts in practice.


## Prerequisites		

This course does not require sophisticated mathematical knowledge nor extensive programming experience.
However, the nature of the material is somewhat technical.
Prior experience in R is required.

## Computing

All computing in class will be conducted in R.
The focus of the class will be on teaching Machine Learning concepts rather than how to use R.
You can find additional resources [here](../computing).

## Textbooks

There are no required textbooks. All materials and notes will be available on the class website.

I recommend looking into the following book.

[**An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R**](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL) <br>
*Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani* <br>
This book provides a great introduction to Machine Learning.
Concepts are well explained, without too much technical details. <br/>
_PDF available online_


_Optional textbooks:_ Books below cover some machine learning topics in more details. We list both technical books and business related books.

[**Elements of Statistical Learning**](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn) <br>
*Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman* <br/>
This book covers similar material to the one above, however, it provides more technical material. <br>
_PDF available online_

[**Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective**](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook) by *Kevin Murphy*   
PhD-level book, providing a encyclopedic survey of the area.

[**Deep Learning**](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by
*Ian Goodfellow* and *Yoshua Bengio* and *Aaron Courville*  
A recent book on deep learning.

The following three books are very light on technical details,
but do talk about applying Machine Learning in the context of business applications.

[**Data Science for Business**](http://data-science-for-biz.com) by *Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett*

[**Predictive analytics**](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118416856.html) by *Eric Siegel*

[**Big Data, Data Mining, and Machine Learning: Value Creation for Business Leaders and Practitioners**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1502462915) by *Jared Dean*


## Evaluation

_Grades_ will be determined by:

- a midweek homework/project (40%)

    There will be a homework assignment during the one day break between classes.    


- a final project (60%)

    The final project can be done alone or in a group. The goal will be to apply Machine Learning to a particular business problem. More details about the project can be found [here](../project).

Students must adhere to Booth Honor Code. But you do not need to include the honor code, and signatures, etc., on your work.
